            <h3>Social Conduct — Discord, Chat & In-Game</h3>
            <blockquote class="important">Please use English so staff can moderate and other players aren't excluded.</blockquote>

            <ul>
                <li>Don’t spam, use excessive caps, or play disruptive sounds in VCs — repeated spam may lead to revoked permissions.</li>
                <li>Maliciously spamming in-game commands (e.g., repeating /rtp) will result in Jail for a minimum of 3 hours.</li>
                <li>Keep conversations respectful. Targeted swearing, hateful content, or derogatory jokes are strictly prohibited.</li>
                <li>No discrimination of any kind — racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or ageist language will be removed and punished.</li>
                <li>No doxing, sharing personal account details, phishing links, or unsafe links — these are immediate ban offenses.</li>
                <li>No advertising other servers or self-promotion unless approved by staff or you’re part of Events/Media teams.</li>
                <li>Do not impersonate staff or try to mini-mod. Tag staff if help is needed.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="voice" class="rule-card">
            <h3>Voice Chat</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>All rules in Social Conduct apply in VC — you're responsible for what you say and share in voice/video.</li>
                <li>Do not share explicit content in voice/video. Be mindful and allow others to speak — don't be disruptive.</li>
                <li>If you feel uncomfortable, leave the VC and report the incident to staff.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="age" class="rule-card">
            <h3>Age & Content</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>We welcome players of all ages but you must follow Discord and Minecraft TOS (Discord requires 13+).</li>
                <li>The server is PG-13; adult channels are age-locked and still forbid tasteless NSFW or explicit material.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="ingame" class="rule-card">
            <h3>In-Game Play</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>No hacking, cheating, abusing commands, or duplicating items.</li>
                <li>No griefing of protected areas or stealing from players' bases; traps, TP-trapping, and AFK attacks are disallowed.</li>
                <li>Report bugs or exploits to staff immediately — exploiting glitches during beta or otherwise is punishable.</li>
                <li>All builds must be suitable for a general audience — explicit, hateful, or excessively violent content will be removed.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="subcard">
                <h4>Alternate accounts</h4>
                <p>Players may have one Bedrock account and one Java account. Using alternate accounts for unfair advantage is strictly prohibited.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="subcard">
                <h4>Farms & grinders</h4>
                <p>Farms that cause server lag or use duping mechanics are not allowed. Staff may ask you to remove or disable a farm — every farm should have a kill switch and be turned off when you are not online.</p>
                <p class="muted">Examples we do not tolerate: large nether roof gold farms, guardian farms, totem farms using abuse mechanics, and other lag/spawn-hogging builds.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="mods" class="rule-card">
            <h3>Allowed client-side mods & packs</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Allowed: HUD mods, minimaps (e.g., Xaero's), performance packs, and non-xray texture packs</li>
                <li>Litematica is allowed for schematics only (no paste)</li>
                <li>Not allowed: auto-clickers, Horion client, or any third-party client that gives unfair advantage (like x-ray clients).</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="trades" class="rule-card">
            <h3>Trades & Purchases</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>No scamming through trades, auctions, or misrepresentation of items.</li>
                <li>Trading or selling in-game items for real money is strictly forbidden.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="muted">Players buy at their own discretion. Use trust and the AH 'sell inventory' features to reduce disputes.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="webstore" class="rule-card">
            <h3>Webstore refunds & chargebacks</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Refund requests must be processed via the owner after a support ticket or direct email to infernoriftsmc@gmail.com.</li>
                <li>Chargebacks to the payment processor will result in immediate bans on Tebex (we cannot reverse chargebacks).</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="punishments" class="rule-card">
            <h3>Punishments & appeals</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Punishments depend on severity and prior offenses. A three-strike system is used for minor issues, but severe actions can lead to immediate permanent bans.</li>
                <li>Respect staff decisions while a punishment is in effect. If you believe a punishment was unfair, open a support ticket for a review.</li>
                <li>Attempting to evade punishment (alternate accounts, books/signs/builds) will escalate your penalty.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <footer class="rules-footer">
            <p>Need help or want clarification? Contact staff via the <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> page or open a support ticket on our Discord.</p>
            <p class="muted small">These rules are enforced alongside Discord / Minecraft Terms of Service. Staff have final say in moderation decisions.</p>
